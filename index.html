    <h1>Why people will</br> soon be on </br>
      <b>Mars?</b>
    </h1>
    <p>Thanks to its technical advances and successful missions, SpaceX wants to make the trip to Mars possible. But, life on
      Mars is still a subject of questions. Our goal, through this website, is to keep you informed of the Mars mission and
      the barriers that will still have to be overcome to achieve it.</p>

        <h1>Concretely,</h1>
        <p>The idea that man can go and settle on the moon is more and more possible. It's no longer a dream or a science fiction
          but a real idea based on evidence, patents, experiencesâ€¦ Man can live on Mars and colonize it.</p>
        <p>It will not undergo jet lag, because the time of the earth and Mars are similar: 24h40. In addition, the trip to
          Mars can only last 39 days if the conditions are ideal. Passengers will be transported by the Colonial Martian
          Transporter (or "Big Fucking Rocket").

        <h1>Our technical progress</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Elon Musk said in February 2014 that the Colonial Transporter Martian would be "100 times larger than an SUV" and
            able to take 100 people to Mars at a time.</b>
        </p>
        <p>The engine fuel Raptor is almost entirely burnt methane and liquid oxygen, based on the previous techniques used
          by SpaceX for their rocket systems, planned for missions to Mars. This means that the Raptor engine can spew about
          <b>306'175 kilograms</b> of thrust, and is about three times more powerful than the Merlin engines of the Falcon 9.</p>
        <p>Due to the presence of water in the Martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the Mars planet, methane,
          which is a simple hydrocarbon, can be easily shyntesized on the red planet using the Sabatier reaction.</p>

        <p>The first launch puts the Martian carrier in low orbit with its crew. The 1st floor returns to its starting point.
          the Martian carrier uses some of the fuel it transports to reach the low orbit.</p>
        <div class="shadow"></div>
        <p>The 1st floor is reused after refueling and tests to launch a second stage of type tanker. A transfer operation takes
          place between the two spacecraft. Then the carrier uses his propulsion to leave the low-Earth orbit and enter a
          transit path to Mars.
