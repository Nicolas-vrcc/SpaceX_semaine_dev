  <h1>Why people will soon be on Mars?</h1>
  <p>Thanks to its technical advances and successful missions, SpaceX wants to make the trip to Mars possible. But, life on Mars is still a subject of questions. Our goal, through this website, is to keep you informed of the Mars mission and the barriers that will still have to be overcome to achieve it.</p>

  <h1>Our technical progress</h1>
  <h2>Elon Musk said in February 2014 that the Colonial Transporter Martian would be "100 times larger than an SUV" and able to take 100 people to Mars at a time.</h2>
  <p>The engine fuel Raptor is almost entirely burnt methane and liquid oxygen, based on the previous techniques used by SpaceX for their rocket systems, planned for missions to Mars. This means that the Raptor engine can spew about 306'175 kilograms of thrust, and is about three times more powerful than the Merlin engines of the Falcon 9.</p>
  <p>Due to the presence of water in the Martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the Mars planet, methane, which is a simple hidrocarbon, can be easily synthesized on the red planet using the Sabatier reaction.</p>

        <h1>Concretely,</h1>
        <p>The idea that man can go and settle on the moon is more and more possible. It's no longer a dream or a science fiction but a real idea based on evidence, patents, experiencesâ€¦ Man can live on Mars and colonize it.</p>
        <p>It will not undergo jet lag, because the time of the earth and Mars are similar: 24h40. In addition, the trip to Mars can only last 39 days if the conditions are ideal. Passengers will be transported by the Colonial Martian Transporter (or "Big
          Fucking Rocket").
